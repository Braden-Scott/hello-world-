# hello-world-
This is my first repository

I'm a highschool student who doesn't know much about code but wants to have a good grasp on it.

I think it would probably be important to learn code as we are becoming a more technology oriented society.

I am currently learning HTML and Css. 

Cheers,
Luffiey
